* ANI analysis was performed using pyani with default parameters
* 200 RefSeq *L. fermentum* genomes were mainly separted into 4 groups
* Most of the genomes (157) are inside group 1 and 2 (>99% identity)
* Group 3 genomes (34) have 92~94% CheckM completeness
* Group 4 genomes (9) have 88~91% CheckM completeness and fragmented structure (>100 contigs)
