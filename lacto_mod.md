## Virulence factor / Antibacterial resistance gene analysis

* Virulence factor analysis was performed by [VirulenceFinder v2.0.3](https://cge.food.dtu.dk/services/VirulenceFinder/) with all species selected.
* Antibacterial resistance gene analysis was performed by [ResFinder v4.4.1](http://genepi.food.dtu.dk/resfinder) with default parameters.
----

* No virulence factor or antibacterial resistance gene was found in all 3 strains.
