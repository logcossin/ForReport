* All 3 strains assembled into one complete circular chromosome and plasmids with over 99% genome completeness ([CheckM v1.2.3](https://github.com/Ecogenomics/CheckM)).
* Species was predicted with ANI analysis.

## Virulence factor / Antibacterial resistance gene analysis

* Virulence factor analysis was performed by [ABRicate v1.0.1](https://github.com/tseemann/abricate).
* Antibacterial resistance gene analysis was performed by [staramr v0.10.0](https://github.com/phac-nml/staramr).
----

* No virulence factor or antibacterial resistance gene was found in all 3 strains.
